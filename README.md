# discrete-sectional-jam
The discrete sectional julia aerosol module (JAM) is a Julia language implementation of the discrete-sectional method to simulate an evolving aerosol (Li and Cai, 2020: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2020.105615). It was created for the final project for ENE 527: Climate Change and Aerosols at University of Southern California.
